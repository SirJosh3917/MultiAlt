# Uses
You could add 5 alts to a world, and fill the entire world 5 times faster than normally.

You can make a big list of messages to send, and then all the AltManager will split up the work and tell each alt what to do.

AltManager allows for an easy OnMessage, and it is very easy to tell which alt recieved the message, and provides an easy function to send messages from that alt.

Alts also have a built in storage, so you can do `Alt["key"] = "value"` to store data inside of the alt for easy access.
